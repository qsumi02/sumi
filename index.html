 <h1>BLOOD</h1>
    <p>Blood is a<strong><em><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Wiki_Loves_Africa_2022/en">specialised connective tissue</a></em></strong> in mammals containing formed elements.The average volume of adult whole blood is <strong>5.5L</strong>.In males,it ranges from <strong>5.0-6.0L</strong>,and in females,<strong>4.5-5.5L</strong>.Blood accounts for <strong>6-8% </strong> of an healthy human body weight(<strong>70kg</strong>).The liquid component of blood <strong>i.e Plasma</strong>,consists of <strong>55%</strong>of whole blood. It transport large amount of internal heat to the skin.</p>
    <p>Plasma contains proteins,electrolytes,antibodies,carbohydrates and other molecules. The important plasma proteins are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Albumins</li>
        <li>Alpha Globulins</li>
        <li>Beta Globulins</li>
        <li>Gamma Globulins</li>,

    </ul>

        <td><p>Erythrocytes are flattened,biconcave discs about <strong>7um</strong> in diameter and <strong>2.2um </strong>thick. They lack <srtong>nuclei and mitochondria </srtong>and hence obtain energy through <stong> anaerobic metabolism </stong.> Erythrocytes are produced from the bone marrow, and about <srtong>200 Billion </srtong> red blood cells are produced each day. Each erythrocytes contains approximately <strong> 280 million </strong>hemoglobin molecules. Each hemoglobin molecule consists of four protein chains called <strong>Globins</strong>, each of which is bound to one heme; a red- pigmented molecule that contains <strong>iron</strong>.</p>
            <p>Red blood cells are produced by erythropoiesis.it is first produced from mesenchyme of yolk sac during the first 2 months of intrauterine life. From the third month on, the liver, spleen and lymph node starts to produce red blood cells, stem cells then migrate from there to the bone marrow during the fourth months and become the permanent site for production of red and other blood cells. </p></td>
